 - Make convenience functions for all the DMA init functions
 - Make other txECAN1 functions for taking a canMsg, a MATLAB-style array of ints.
 - Add constructor for canMsg
 - Add DMA-initialization code to init() functions
 - Keep DMA interrupts from being compiled if they're not needed to avoid conflicts with user code
 - Create crosswire example in Simulink (block for reading data should also provide size of circ buffer)
